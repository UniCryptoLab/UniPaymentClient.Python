[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/unipayment.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/unipayment)

A Python client for the [UniPayment Client API](https://unipayment.readme.io/reference/overview).  

This SDK provides a convenient abstraction of UniPayment's Gateway API and allows developers to focus on payment flow/e-commerce integration rather than on the specific details of client-server interaction using the raw API.


## Getting Started

[SDK Tutorial](https://unipayment.io/en/docs/sdk/tutorial/)

Before using the UniPayment API, sign up for your [API key](https://console.unipayment.io/).

If you want to use the Sandbox, sign up [here](https://sandbox-console.unipayment.io/).

## Installation

### Manual
1. Download the package and extract it into a local directory or clone the repo.
2. cd into the root directory where setup.py is located.
3. Enter：
```bash
python setup.py install
```
### Using pip
```bash
pip install unipayment
```


## Initializing UniPayment client
```python
from unipayment import UniPaymentClient

client = UniPaymentClient('client id','client secret')
```

Sandbox is used in the same way with is_sandbox as true.

```python
from unipayment import UniPaymentClient

now_pay = UniPaymentClient('client id', 'client secret',is_sandbox=True)
```

## Create an invoice
> Reference：https://unipayment.readme.io/reference/create_invoice

```python
from unipayment import UniPaymentClient, CreateInvoiceRequest

client_id='your client id'
client_secret='your client secret'

request = CreateInvoiceRequest()
request.price_amount=10
request.price_currency='USD'
request.notify_url='https://example.com/notify'
request.redirect_url='https://example.com/redirect'
request.order_id='#123456'
request.title='MacBook Air'
request.description='MacBookAir (256#)'

client = UniPaymentClient(client_id, client_secret)
create_invoice_response = client.create_invoice(request)
```
### CreateInvoiceResponse

```python
{'code': 'OK',
 'data': {'address': None,
          'app_id': 'cee1b9e2-d90c-4b63-9824-d621edb38012',
          'confirm_speed': 'Medium',
          'create_time': datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 13, 6, 56, 17),
          'error_status': 'None',
          'exchange_rate': 0.0,
          'expiration_time': datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 13, 7, 1, 17),
          'invoice_id': '6BsP75vBQFvTksa9fNxoEk',
          'invoice_url': 'https://sandbox-app.unipayment.io/i/6BsP75vBQFvTksa9fNxoEk',
          'network': None,
          'order_id': 'your order id',
          'paid_amount': 0.0,
          'pay_amount': 0.0,
          'pay_currency': None,
          'price_amount': 100.2,
          'price_currency': 'USD',
          'status': 'New'},
 'msg': ''}

```

## Handle IPN
> Reference：https://unipayment.readme.io/reference/ipn-check

> Invoice Status: https://unipayment.readme.io/reference/invoice-status

IPNs (Instant Payment Notifications) are sent to the notify_url when order status is changed to paid, confirmed and complete. 

```python

@app.route("/handle-notify", methods=['POST'])
def check_notify():
    notify = request.get_json()
    app_id = 'your app id'
    api_key = 'your api key'

    client = UniPaymentClient(app_id, api_key)
    try:
        check_ipn_response = client.check_ipn(notify)
        if check_ipn_response.code == 'OK':
            # ipn is valid, we can handel status
            if notify['status'] == 'Confirmed':
                # payment is confirmed, we can process order here
                print('invoice is confirmed')
        else:
            # ipn is not valid
            pass
    except ApiException as e:
        print(e)

```
